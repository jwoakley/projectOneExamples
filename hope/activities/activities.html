                        This is an advertisement for Tyler, The Creator's Golf Lefleur fragrance line.
                        I am a big fan of Tyler, so maybe Instagram's algorithm caught wind of it!
                        I have been looking around online for a new perfume, so it's understandable that
                        this ad was shown to me. I haven't smelled this perfume yet, but now that I saw this ad,
                        I'm thinking of trying it out!

                        This is an advertisement for Ana Luisa Jewelery's rings! I'm a <em>jewelery girl</em>,
                        and I was checking their website out before I stumbled upon this advertisement on Instagram.
                        I love jewelery, especially rings! I feel like rings embellish the hands very well, especially if
                        you have nail extensions; it makes hands look so pretty!

                        This is an advertizement for Seree Jewelery! This is also an ad for jewelery that I stumbled upon 
                        after visiting their website looking for new earrings and necklaces. I love crystal/gem jewelery, but I would
                        not buy gemstones (especially jade) online and would rather buy it in-person so I know it's real!

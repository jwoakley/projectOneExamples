                    This is a playlist I made of the singer and songwriter, Laufey. It is a compilation of songs from her discography. I am currently in my, what the kids would say, "Laufey Era". I listen to this
                    playlist when I'm doing homework, cleaning my apartment, or in need of some jazzy-pop background music. 
                </p> 
                <br>
                <p>
                    I love Laufey! Personally, she is an absolute icon who is a pedestal in reviving a music genre that was slowly dying within the context of pop culture today. Even though her music is a fusion of genres like 
                    Modern Jazz, Bossa Nova, and Bedroom Pop, her inspiration are icons like Etta James, Ella Fitzgerald, Chet Baker, Nat King Cole, etc. She frequently adds her own renditions of her favorite 
                    songs from these very artists, paying homage to them in her discography.

                    "Riding In The Car With My Boomer Immigrant Parents."<br>
                    Cover: Linda Ronstadt (1976)
                </p>
                <p>
                    This playlist is a compilation of songs that used to play in the car when I was a child. These songs are mostly what we would be listening to,
                    which were custom CDs that my parents would ask my older sisters to make from their collection of albums we had at home.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As the title suggests, my parents were born in the baby boomer era, which makes them 'boomers'! However, they are also first-generation immigrants 
                    from Micronesia and the Phillipines. I listen to this playlist whenever I'm driving and don't have anything else to listen to, or when I want
                    to feel nostalgic.

                Frank Ocean is my favorite artist of ALL TIME! Once I had my hands on a Spotify Premium account,
                I made a playlist of all of his music right away. However, I have yet to add <em>all</em> of the other songs
                that he has featured in, but I'm content with this playlist at the moment.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I listen to this playlist whenever I want to think. Frank Ocean has been in my life since I've been
                in middle school, so he is a big part of my tween years, teen years, and now growing with
                me into my adulthood. I wanted to see him perform at Coachella 2023 this year, but I <strong><em>am not</em></strong>
                a super rich kid, but what I tell myself is that <strong>my time will come.</strong>

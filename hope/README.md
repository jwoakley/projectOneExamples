# project overview
This is the "Digital TIme Capsule‚Äù by Hope Marie David. The goal of this project was to record and visualize the digital footprint across social media platforms, compile it into a personal website, and submit it as a class project. Some attributes included within this site are personal photos, Spotify playlists, as well as advertisements from Instagram's story feature. 

# technical overview
This website consists of three pages: a bio/home page, a likes page, and an activities page. The bio/home page contains a photo and bio paragraph, side by side. The likes page is a page dedicated to music interests. The activities page contains advertisements that have been collected from Instagram. All three of these pages were coded and styled using HTML and CSS in the software, Visual Studio Code (2019). Other various design aspects in each page were aided by an iPad Pro and two different software applications, Adobe Illustrator and Procreate.

                Hope-Marie David was born on September 26, 2001, in Vallejo, CA, and currently resides in San Carlos, CA. 
                She is the youngest of five children who are of mixed Filipino-Micronesian heritage and is a first-generation college student. When she grows up, her dream is to be a children’s book author and illustrator!
                She is currently a fourth-year San Francisco State University student pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Speech-Language and Hearing Sciences. 
                On campus, she serves as the President of SFSU's Student Academy of Audiology chapter and is a student researcher in the SFSU ‘Find Your Voice’ Lab and the SFSU/UCSF Audiology Lab. <br>

              Hope loves to read! Some of her favorite books are Tuesdays with Morrie by Mitch Albom, Crying in H-Mart by Michelle Zauner (shoutout to Japanese Breakfast!), and On Earth, We’re Briefly Gorgeous by Ocean Vuong. 
                She is also actively collecting Sonny Angel Baby Figurines and has a total of 11 babies! In her free time, you could catch her reading a book from her To-Be-Read list, which is currently The Joy Luck Club by Amy Tan or A Breath of Life by Clarice Lispector. She likes to read two books at a time to keep things interesting! (Never let them know your next move…) She also frequents boba shops and cafes across the SF Bay Area. If you can’t find her there, she is probably trying different restaurants from her bookmarked list on Yelp! 
                Hope is a “material girl” and loves to “pasyal” or window-shop/stroll in Tagalog. She sometimes musters up the courage to buy things and justifies it by saying, “Money comes back!” You can usually find her strolling through the Hillsdale Shopping Center in San Mateo, or at the Westfield Valley Fair Mall in Santa Clara. <br>

            Hope loves music and often has different phases where she listens to one artist at a time. Right now, her favorite artists are Laufey, Niki, and New Jeans. Her favorite artists of all time are Frank Ocean, Mac Miller, Snoh Aalegra, and Jorja Smith. For concerts, Hope loves attending concerts, raves, and music festivals! Her most recent music festival, concert, and rave were Second Sky at Oracle Arena, Thuy at the Regency Ballroom, and Illenium at Bill Graham Civic Center. In her art and designs, she is often nostalgic and influenced by the books and media she consumed as a child. Welcome to her website!

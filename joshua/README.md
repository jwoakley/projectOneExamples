Time Capsule by Joshua Thatcher

# project overview
This website is a presentation of the skills I have developed over the course of the semester learning HTML and CSS at San Francisco State University. The first page that you land on for my website is the home page. This is where there is a picture of myself, and a bit of a backstory on me and the other pages of the site. At the top of the web page is my nav bar where you can click to move between "Home", "Likes" and "Activity". "Likes" takes you to a webpage filled with some of my favorite video games. There are some paragraphs dedicated to different games and genres, with accompanying sets of images beneath them. In the "Activity" page, you can look at some of my latest Plant Activity, explaining where I have been going to shop for succulents and other plants, as well as image sets of my plant setups.

# technical overview
For this project I mainly worked with HTML and CSS to create the website. I began by generating the text content for each of my web pages, collecting all of the images I would use, and then start building the code in Visual Studio Code. I also synced the project with my github account to keep an updated version of the website in the online repo. Github also publishes the website online.

            One of Josh's longest lasting hobbies is his passion for video games. Ever since he was little and got his hands on a Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), he has been a gamer at heart for as long as he can remember.
            He enjoys all types of games, and frequently finds himself picking up something new that is a different genre to change things up. Some of his all-time favorite games include single-player story-driven games such as "The Last of Us".
            He firmly believes that all forms of art and design can be a medium to portray social issues and give people a voice who typically are repressed, whether it be music, painting, movies, or video games.
            He loves playing games like "The Last of Us" which portrays LGBT characters in a strong, human, relatable, and beautiful way.
            Some of his other favorite single-player games include "The Witcher 3", "God of War", and "The Walking Dead".

            As a transplant from the East Coast with many friends in different time zones, Josh also values his gaming as a way to connect with friends across the country.
            When he games as a social activity, he prefers to play games that allow him to group up with his friends and play competitively on a team against other people. 
            Many of his favorite competitive games are games that he and his friends have been playing for years, such as "League of Legends", although some are newer games such as "Battlefield 2042".
            While the competitive nature of these games is fun in itself, Josh mainly plays these games so that he can catch up with his friends and have some laughs along the way.
            He also loves to play cooperative games, where he and his friends are able to play in a group through a narrative-driven story, or are placed in situations where he and his friends have to work together to survive.
            Some of his favorite coop and survival games that he can play with his friends include "Baldur's Gate 3", "The Forest", and "Valheim".
